# odin-restaurant-page

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involved creating a restaurant page for a imaginary restaurant with 3 tabs: Home, Menu and Contact pages. The development of this project involved the usage of ES6 modules, `npm` package manager and Webpack bundler for bundling the project and using Hot Module Reload. The project allowed to go over the material about the Javascript learnt during the development of [Tic-Tac-Toe project](https://github.com/bulkassi/odin-tic-tac-toe).
The project (bundled using Webpack) is deployed using separate branch `gh-pages`.
